### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Here at https://github.com/svenk you find a couple of open source software I published. Since I ~typically~ _used to_ commit
with `<user@computer-name>` credentials, my contribution activity is sparse.

See also my gists at https://gist.github.com/svenk.
I also publish my work over there at Bitbucket: https://bitbucket.org/svek/
<!--Unfortunately, most of my code resides in closed-access selfhosted Gitlab repositories.-->
Head over to my personal website at https://svenk.org/ for more links.
