### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Here at http://github.com/svenk you find a couple of open source software I published. Since I typically commit
with `<user@computer-name>` credentials, my contribution activity is sparse.

I also publish my work over there at Bitbucket: http://bitbucket.org/svek/
However, most of my code resides in closed-access selfhosted Gitlab repositories.
